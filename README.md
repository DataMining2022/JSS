# Leveraging Advanced Data Mining Algorithms to Recommend Source Code Changes

This is the replication package of our paper for the JSS journal. 

The package consists of our datasets for 7 open-source projects (Eclipse, Elasticsearch, Rhino, SWT, Kotlin, Guava, and JabRef) as well as generated rules for investigated FPM algorithms (Apriori, FP-Growth, Eclat, and Relim).
